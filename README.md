# Web Models UI

A user interface that allows users to select from a wide array of functional models.  Once a model is chosen, it's associated input parameters are displayed.

You can then supply custom values and execute the model.

This will allow users to execute our backend models in a web browser, eliminating the learning curve associated with running the models in their native thick-client framework.
